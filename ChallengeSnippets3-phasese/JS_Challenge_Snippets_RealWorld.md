# 🔧 Step 3: Real-World Challenge Snippets

Each phase includes 2 challenges (1 medium, 1 hard) using everyday themes.

## 📘 Phase 1: Objects
### 🟡 Medium – 🧍‍♀️ People / Profiles
**Challenge:** Create an object for a user profile with properties like name, age, and country. Add a method called `getSummary()` that returns a formatted sentence like: "Ali is 30 years old from Somalia."

### 🔴 Hard – 🏠 House / Furniture
**Challenge:** Create a constructor function for Furniture that accepts name, material, and price. Include a method `getInfo()` that returns a string describing the furniture. Then create two different furniture items and log their info.

## 📗 Phase 2: Arrays
### 🟡 Medium – 🍽️ Recipes / Kitchen
**Challenge:** Create an array of recipe objects with name and cookingTime. Use `filter()` to return all recipes that take less than 30 minutes. Then use `map()` to return just the recipe names.

### 🔴 Hard – 🌍 Places / Travel
**Challenge:** Create an array of destinations, each with a name and `visitorsPerYear`. Use `sort()` to arrange them from most to least visited. Then use `forEach()` to log each one as "Destination: ___, Visitors: ___"

## 📙 Phase 3: Functions
### 🟡 Medium – 💼 Companies / Employees
**Challenge:** Write a higher-order function `processEmployee(name, callback)` that uses a callback to send a welcome message. Create at least two callbacks: `welcomeEmail()` and `orientationReminder()`.

### 🔴 Hard – 🏪 Shops / Products
**Challenge:** Create a closure `createProduct(name, price)` that hides the price, and only allows access via `getName()` and `getPrice()`. Then create a few product objects and log their name and price using those methods.
