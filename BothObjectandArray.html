    /* 
    Good question!
    You're very close, but let’s slow down and fix it together step-by-step: 🚀
    
    ❗ First Problem in Your Code:
    
    return `Hello, ${this.users.name}`
    
    this.users → is wrong because inside the object users, the names are stored directly in a property called names, not inside users.names again.
    
    Also, names is an array, not a single object — you need to loop through it!
    
    ✅ How to Correct It:
    You want to loop through all the names and return a greeting for each person.
    
    Here’s the correct idea:
    
    */
    // Array inside object
    let users = {
      names: [
        /* { name: "Ali", age: 22 },
        { name: "Zahra", age: 24 },
        { name: "Axmed", age: 21 }, */
      ],

      greeting: function () {
        // Use map() to greet each user
        return this.names.map(user => `Hello, ${user.name}!`);
      }
    }
    /* 🌟 BONUS
    If you want to print them nicely in the console:
    
    users.greeting().forEach(greet => console.log(greet)); 
    OR*/

    for (let greet of users.greeting()) {
      console.log(greet)
    }

    /* 📝 Summary:
    Method	Purpose	Example
    for...of loop	Walk through array manually	Good for flexibility
    .forEach() method	Apply a function to each item	Good for cleaner, shorter code
    ✅ Both are correct and good.
    ✅ You can use whichever you feel more comfortable with.
    ✅ In professional code, both styles are used depending on the situation. */

    //Object inside Array
    let userInfo = [

      /*  { name: "Sara", age: 22 },
       { name: "Zahuur", age: 24 },
       { name: "Khalid", age: 21 }, */
    ]
    /* userInfo.forEach(function(greet){
    console.log(`Hello, ${greet.name}`);
    }) */
    // filter is a same()
    userInfo.map(userName => {
    //  console.log(`Welcome, ${userName.name}`);
    })

let student = {
  name: "Khalid",
  showName: function() {
