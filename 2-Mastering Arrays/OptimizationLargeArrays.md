✅ Next Topic: Performance Optimization with Large Arrays
This topic is not about just speed — it’s about writing smart and efficient code when working with big datasets, which is very common in real-world projects.

🔍 Why Is This Important?
When your array has 100,000+ items (think: users, products, comments), your code can:

Slow down the browser or crash it

Take too much memory

Freeze your UI when looping or rendering

You need techniques to optimize performance, so your app stays smooth and fast.

✅ Core Concepts to Learn:
Avoid Mutating the Original Array (when not necessary)
Use non-mutating methods like slice(), filter(), map() instead of splice(), sort() (which mutate the original).

Use for loops for speed-sensitive tasks
In high-performance situations, traditional for loops are faster than forEach() or map().

Use find() instead of filter() when you only need one result
Don’t search the entire array if you just want the first match.

Avoid Repeated .length or .map() Inside Loops
Cache values like array length or computed results outside the loop if they won’t change.

Lazy evaluation with .some() or .every()
These stop early once the result is known — unlike filter() which checks everything.

Use Pagination or Limit Displayed Data in the UI
If displaying thousands of rows, show only 10–20 and use pagination or “load more”.

Use .flatMap() to combine flat + transform steps

✅ Real-World Tips
✔ Example:
If you're working with a list of 10,000 products, and just want to show in-stock discounted products, this would be slow:

```js

products.filter(p => p.discount > 0).filter(p => p.inStock);
```
Better way:

```js

products.filter(p => p.discount > 0 && p.inStock);
```
✔ Example:
Avoid this:

```js

for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
  for (let j = 0; j < array.length; j++) {
    // nested loop can crash performance!
  }
}
```
Instead, use more efficient logic or flatten data outside the loop first.
