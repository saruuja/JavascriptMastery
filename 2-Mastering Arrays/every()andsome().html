  <!-- 
   🔁 What does “reuse these checks elsewhere” mean?
Right now, you wrote two separate functions:

function checkEvery() { ... }
function checkSome() { ... }
They work perfectly — but they only live in this one script.

✅ "Reusing" means:
You might want to use those same checks again in another file, another page, or multiple parts of the same app — instead of rewriting them.
🧱 So what does “wrap inside a reusable object or module” mean?
It means putting those functions into a container (like an object or module) that you can reuse, call anytime, or even import into another file.

✅ Example: Wrapping in an Object
const productChecker = {
  areAllInStock(products) {
    return products.every(product => product.inStock);
  },
  hasAnyDiscount(products) {
    return products.some(product => product.discount !== 0);
  }
};

// Usage
let inStock = productChecker.areAllInStock(products);
let discount = productChecker.hasAnyDiscount(products);


Is called a Utility Object — it’s just grouping related functions together.

You don’t need to build this now at all. But once you get stronger with:

✔ Object methods
✔ Factory functions or constructors
✔ ES6 modules (import/export)

Then this technique will feel easy and natural.
