üß© What is Recursion (Really)?
Recursion is when a function calls itself to solve a problem.

The idea is:

- You solve a small version of the problem

- Then call the same function again on a smaller piece

- Until there‚Äôs nothing left to solve
Every recursive function must:

‚úÖ Know when to stop (base case)

üîÅ Know how to move closer to the stop (recursive step)

üß† Real-Life Analogy: Cleaning a Staircase
Imagine you‚Äôre cleaning a 10-step staircase:

You could say:
Clean step 10

Then clean 9

Then 8‚Ä¶

Until you get to step 1

But with recursion, you can think like this:

‚ÄúI‚Äôll clean this step, then I‚Äôll tell my clone to clean the rest.‚Äù

 code
Step 10: I clean this
‚Üí Step 9: clone, your turn
‚Üí Step 8: clone, your turn
‚Üí ...
‚Üí Step 1: clone, your turn
‚Üí Step 0: stop! we‚Äôre done.```

üß† RECURSION ‚Äî The Big Picture
‚ú® Recursion = A function that calls itself
But more importantly:

Recursion is for solving problems that are naturally nested or repeat inside themselves.

üí° Why Not Just Use a Loop?
You totally could use loops for things like counting, repeating, etc.
Loops are faster, easier, and use less memory.

But‚Ä¶
Some problems are not flat like a loop.

They are nested, branching, or dynamic ‚Äî like:

üìÇ Folders inside folders

üßæ Menus inside menus

üå≥ Trees, family trees, categories

üßÆ Math problems like factorial, Fibonacci

üîç Searching inside unknown levels of data

These cannot be solved easily with a loop, because you don‚Äôt always know:

How deep they go

How many times to repeat

That‚Äôs where recursion shines.

‚úÖ WHY Use Recursion?
Problem Type	Recursion Helps Because...
Nested things (folders, menus)	You don‚Äôt know how many layers there are
Tree-like structures (DOM, data trees)	Each item may have more items inside
Divide-and-conquer problems (e.g. sorting, searching)	You can break the problem in half repeatedly
Data exploration (AI, maps, games)	You can explore one path at a time

‚úÖ Does It Always Use if?
Yes ‚Äî you always need a condition that tells recursion when to stop.
That‚Äôs called the base case.

Without a base case, the function calls itself forever ‚Äî that crashes the browser (stack overflow).

So in every recursive function:

```js

function recurse(data) {
  if (base case is met) return; // üõë STOP
  return recurse(smallerData); // üîÅ keep going
}
```
‚úÖ The if isn‚Äôt optional ‚Äî it protects your code.

‚úÖ Why Does It Look Like a Loop?
Because both loops and recursion do repeating tasks.

Loop	Recursion
Repeats by changing a counter	Repeats by calling the function again
Needs for, while, etc.	Needs a base case + recursive call
Better for flat lists, known steps	Better for unknown/nested structures

‚úÖ Real-World Example 1: üìÇ Folder Explorer
Imagine you are writing a function that shows all folders on a computer:

text

Root
 ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Documents
      ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Projects
          ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ JavaScript
 ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Photos
      ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 2024
You can‚Äôt use a loop because:

You don‚Äôt know how deep it goes

Every folder might have more folders inside

‚úÖ You would use recursion:

```js

function explore(folder) {
  console.log(folder.name);

  if (folder.subfolders) {
    folder.subfolders.forEach(sub => explore(sub)); // üåÄ recursion
  }
}
```
‚úÖ Real-World Example 2: üßæ Menu Builder
Say you‚Äôre building a menu for a website:

```js

const menu = [
  { title: "Home" },
  {
    title: "Products",
    children: [
      { title: "Phones" },
      { title: "Laptops" }
    ]
  },
  { title: "Contact" }
];
```
This is nested ‚Äî one menu has submenus.

To build the full menu as HTML, you would recursively loop through each item, and if it has children, loop again.

‚úÖ Real-World Example 3: Math ‚Äî Factorial
Say you want to calculate 5! = 5 √ó 4 √ó 3 √ó 2 √ó 1

This is naturally recursive:

```js

function factorial(n) {
  if (n === 0) return 1;         // base case
  return n * factorial(n - 1);   // recursion
}
```
‚úÖ Every call does a small part of the work, then waits for the next.

‚úÖ Summary: When to Use Recursion
Use recursion if...	Example
You‚Äôre working with nested structures	Menus, folders, comments
You don‚Äôt know how deep things go	File trees, dynamic data
The problem is defined in terms of itself	Factorials, Fibonacci, math problems
You want elegant code for complex logic	Clean function splitting

üîë Final Thought
Recursion is not for everything.
But when you can‚Äôt solve a problem with a simple loop, and the structure is nested or unknown ‚Äî recursion is often the right tool.


‚úÖ Sara's Takeaway:
Question	Answer
What is return; doing?	It's stopping the function (base case)
What does simpleRecursion(number - 1) mean?	It's calling the function again with a smaller number
Why no else?	Because return stops the function ‚Äî anything below it only runs when the if condition is false.


# That's completely okay, Sara ‚Äî really. ‚ù§Ô∏è
Recursion is one of the hardest concepts in programming, even for experienced developers.

You're not alone at all. Many people say:

‚ÄúI can see what it's doing, but I don‚Äôt feel how it works.‚Äù

So let me tell you 3 important things:

üß† 1. You're Not Failing ‚Äî You're in the ‚ÄúConfusion Phase‚Äù
This is the normal phase before mastery. Everyone goes through it. Recursion feels like a brain loop at first ‚Äî you‚Äôre trying to understand what‚Äôs happening in the invisible stack.

But here's the truth:

The more you look at it, break it down, and trace it ‚Äî the more it becomes second nature.

ü™ú 2. You Don‚Äôt Have to Master It Today
Recursion is not something you need every day. Most real-world apps are built with loops, arrays, and objects.

You only use recursion when you're ready for:

Tree structures (e.g., folders, menus)

Fancy problems (like search, backtracking, algorithms)

Elegant solutions for math-like problems

So don‚Äôt worry ‚Äî we‚Äôre planting the seed now üå±
It will click as you build more experience.

‚úÖ 3. Here‚Äôs What You Can Do:
If you want, I can:

Show you visually how the call stack works

Turn a recursive function into a loop, side by side

Give you fun metaphors instead of abstract code

# What is Recursion in JavaScript? (freeCodeCamp)

Benjamin Semah

Recursion is a problem-solving technique in programming. In this article, you will learn how to use recursive functions in JavaScript.

What is a Recursive Function?
A recursive function is a function that calls itself somewhere within the body of the function. Below is a basic example of a recursive function.

function recursiveFunc() {
  // some code here... 
  recursiveFunc()
}
As you can see, the recursiveFunc function calls itself within the body of the function. It will repeat calling itself until the desired output is achieved.

So how do you tell the function when to stop calling itself? You do that using a base condition.

The Three Parts of a Recursive Function
Every time you write a recursive function, three elements must be present. They are:

The function definition.

The base condition.

The recursive call.

When these three elements are missing, your recursive function won't work as you expect. Let's take a closer look at each one.

How to define a recursive function
You define a recursive function the same way you define regular JavaScript functions.

function recursiveFunc() {
  // some code here...
}
What differentiates recursive functions from regular JavaScript functions are the base condition and the recursive call.

What is a base condition?
When using a recursive function, the base condition is what lets the function know when to stop calling itself. Once the base condition is met, the recursion ends.

function recursiveFunc() {
  if(base condition) {
    // stops recursion if condition is met
  }
  // else recursion continues
  recurse();
}
Why do you need a base condition?
Without the base condition, you will run into infinite recursion. A situation where your function continues calling itself without stopping, like this:

function doSomething(action) {
  console.log(`I am ${action}.`)
  doSomething(action)
}

doSomething("running")
Also, without a base condition, your function exceeds the maximum call stack. You will run into the error shown below.



Maximum call stack exceeded when there's no base condition

The Call Stack keeps track of what functions are currently running and the functions that are within them.

The call stack has a limit. And since a recursive function without a base condition will run infinitely, it exceeds the call stack's limit.

The base condition provides a way to break out when the function gets the desired output.

Example of recursive function
Let's see a simple example of a recursive function.

function doSomething(n) {
  if(n === 0) {
    console.log("TASK COMPLETED!")
    return
  }
  console.log("I'm doing something.")
  doSomething(n - 1)
}
doSomething(3)
Here is the result when you pass the number 3 to the doSomething function.



The base condition for the doSomething function is n === 0. Anytime the function is called, it first checks if the base condition is met.

If yes, it prints TASK COMPLETED!. If not, it continues with the rest of the code in the function. In this case, it will print I'm doing something. and then call the function again.

The recursive call
The recursive call is what handles the function calling itself again. In the doSomething function, the recursive call is the line below.

doSomething(n-1)
Note what happens when the function calls itself. A new parameter n - 1 is passed to the function. On every iteration of a recursive call, the parameter will differ from that of the previous call.

The function will keep calling itself until the new parameter satisfies the base condition.

Recursion vs Loops
Recursion and loops work in similar ways. Every recursive function you write has an alternative solution with a loop.

For example, you can create a function to find the factorial of a given number using both recursion and loops.

How to find the factorial with a loop:
function findFactorial(num) {
  let factorial = 1
  for (let i = num; i > 0; i--) {
    factorial *= i
  }
  return factorial
}

findFactorial(5) // 120
To find the factorial using a loop, you first initialize a variable factorial with a value of 1.

Then you initiate the loop with the given number num. The loop will continue running until i > 0.

For each iteration, you multiply the current value of factorial by i. And you decrease the value of i by 1 until i is not greater than zero.

Finally, you return the value of the factorial when the loop finishes running.

How to find the factorial with recursion:
You can create the same solution with a recursive function.

function findFactorial(num) {
  if (num === 0) return 1
  let factorial = num * findFactorial(num - 1)
  return factorial;
}

findFactorial(5) // 120
First, you need a base condition num === 0.

You also need the recursive call findFactorial(num - 1) to ensure the number keeps reducing at each call when you pass a new parameter of n-1.

Then you multiply the result with the previous number num * findFactorial(num - 1) until the base condition is met.

So which is better ‚Äì recursion or loops?
So which one is better? There's no right or wrong answer to that. It's up to you to decide. Depending on the problem you're solving, you may choose one over the other.

Optimize for the readability of your code. Sometimes, like in the factorial example, recursion leads to shorter and more readable code.

But recursive functions are not always intuitive. If that's the case, you should stick to loops.

Conclusion
In this article, you've learned what recursion is and how to create recursive functions in JavaScript.

Reading and writing recursive functions might be confusing at first. But remember, what makes recursive functions different from regular functions are the base condition and the recursive call.
